##  Setup Instructions

 1. Clone the Repository

 git clone https://github.com/SHASWATprakash/UserAuthApp.git
 cd UserAuthApp
 2. Install Dependencies

 npm install
3. Install iOS Pods (if on macOS)

 cd ios && pod install && cd ..
4. Start the Metro Bundler


 npx react-native start
5. Run the App
Android:



 npx react-native run-android
iOS:



 npx react-native run-ios
6. Reset Metro Cache (if needed)
If you change assets or encounter module errors:


 npx react-native start --reset-cache

##  Usage
Signup with a new name/email/password.

After signup you are automatically logged in and taken to the Home screen.

Logout from the Home screen to return to the Login screen.

Login again with the same credentials to test persistence.

Toggle Password Visibility by tapping the eye/no-eye icon next to the password field.

##  Security Note
This app stores user data in plaintext locally using AsyncStorage â€” this is for demonstration only.
For production apps:

Use a secure backend with hashed passwords.

Store tokens securely (e.g. expo-secure-store or Keychain/Keystore).
